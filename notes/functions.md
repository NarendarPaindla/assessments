## 🧩 What is a Function?
A **function** is like a reusable "mini-program" inside your code.  
- It groups instructions together.  
- You can "call" it whenever you need it.  
- It saves time because you don’t have to repeat the same code again and again.

Think of it like a **microwave oven**:  
- You put food inside, press a button, and it does its job.  
- You don’t need to know all the details of how it works inside.  
- You just use it when needed.

## 📝 Basic Python Function Example

```python
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name, "Welcome to Python!")

# Calling the function
greet("Rahul")
greet("Anita")
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- `def greet(name):` → This defines a function called **greet** that takes one input (`name`).
- `print("Hello", name, "Welcome to Python!")` → This is what the function does.
- `greet("Rahul")` → Calls the function with "Rahul".
- `greet("Anita")` → Calls the function with "Anita".

Output:
```
Hello Rahul Welcome to Python!
Hello Anita Welcome to Python!
```

## 🍕 Real-World Example: Pizza Order Function

Imagine you run a pizza shop. Instead of writing the same steps every time someone orders, you can use a function:

```python
def order_pizza(size, topping):
    print("You ordered a", size, "pizza with", topping)

# Calling the function
order_pizza("Large", "Cheese")
order_pizza("Medium", "Paneer")
```

Output:
```
You ordered a Large pizza with Cheese
You ordered a Medium pizza with Paneer
```

## 🎯 Why Functions Are Useful
- **Reusability**: Write once, use many times.
- **Organization**: Code looks cleaner and easier to read.
- **Flexibility**: Functions can take inputs and give outputs.
- **Debugging**: Easier to find and fix errors.
